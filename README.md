# Particle System
Salaar Kohari

Particles include position, velocity, acceleration, and color information.  
Acceleration is set depending on distance and direction to the relevant target, and forces are updated accordingly.  
Color also depends on distance to target, getting whiter as it approaches the target.  
The target for particles to flock around is set by clicking on the screen, which projects a ray in that direction from the camera.  
Much of the particle system is left unfinished due to my traveling for the GDC; I could make more progress after returning if you'd accept it.
